## About Project

CityWhisper aims to rebond people with our physical environment in the digital age.  
It is geolocation-based app which encourgas people to seek new or memorable places where they would like to leave messages, pictures, or creative works to others in order to inspire their friends, families and the collective by sharing their love and ideas. 
It is practically achievable to have location-associated messages which people have to take physical efforts to go to the designated place to uncover them. In the other way the delivered messages make the place become more meaningful between people.
